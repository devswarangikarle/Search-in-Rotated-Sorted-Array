# Search-in-Rotated-Sorted-Array
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).  Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 &lt;= k &lt; nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed).
